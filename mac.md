## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git? Git is the most popular distributed version control system.
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub? Git encompasses the entire collection of files and folders associated with a project, along with each file's revision history while GitHub hosts Git repositories and provides developers with tools to ship better code through command line features, issues, pull requests, code review.
3. Why do we create a branch? Branches serve as an abstraction for the edit/stage/commit process.
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request? A Pull Request lets you review differences between branches. 
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main. git checkout -b
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do? `git fetch`  command downloads commits, files, and refs from a remote repository into your local repo. `git merge` command is typically used to combine changes made on two distinct branches. `git pull` updates the local line of development with updates from its remote counterpart.
7. What is a merge conflict? A merge conflict occurs when competing changes are made to the same line of a file or when one person edits a file and another person deletes the same file.
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict? You must choose which changes to incorporate from the different branches in a new commit.
